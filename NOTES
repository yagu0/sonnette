Toy social network: not OK for prod (and clumsily written: I discovered Vue.js not long before)
(But if you add an authentication method, some privacy settings + sanitization it might be usable)

I prefer the concept of decentralized social network: see https://diasporafoundation.org/

Question to ask: what happens if a profile is deleted? Easy fix? And a group? ... (CASCADE)

misc TODOs:
 - Styling...
 - Notifications, messages
 - Unify things creation / edition to permit it from anywhere
 - Show potential affinities everywhere (people you may know, groups of friends ...)
 - sort by degrees of separation + show path, in "discover" page [seems hard]
